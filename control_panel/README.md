This repository contains the Arduino IDE code for the control
panel project I completed for my son. It consists of several 
switch-controlled LEDs, several multi-character 7Segment LED
displays, a numeric keypad and an 84x68 LCD display.

All circuits run off of a single Teensy 3.0 Arduino.

Please see the project blog entries for more details and a complete
BOM listing:
