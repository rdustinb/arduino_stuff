Arduino code project to create a "bubbling LED Lamp" which
utilizes the Arduino PWM channels on the target microcontroller.
This project is Arduino device independent, simply modify the
LEDCNT and LED[] variables accordingly to support whichever
device is being targeted and however many LEDs are in the 
system.
